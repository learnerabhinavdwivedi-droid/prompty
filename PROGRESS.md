- [x] `countTokens(text, tokenizer?)` — 3-tier: custom → lookup → ceil(charLen/4)
- [x] `replacementTokenSavings(original, replacement, tokenizer?)` — token delta check
- [x] Pluggable tokenizer: `compress(text, { tokenizer: t => encode(t).length })`
- [x] New stats: originalTokens, compressedTokens, rosettaTokens, totalCompressedTokens, tokenizerUsed
- [x] Token-aware Rosetta Stone net-positive filter
- [x] All 51 tests passing (5 test files, vitest)
- [x] Benchmarked: 12.6% real savings on verbose prompts, zero false positives
- [x] npm SDK published: `tokenshrink@2.0.0`
- [x] Website updated with token counts in UI
- [x] Docs page updated with tokenizer option + new API fields
- [x] README + SDK README updated with real benchmarks
- [x] Committed + pushed to main → Vercel auto-deployed

- [ ] Self-hosted Docker image
- [ ] Multilingual prompt support
- [ ] Scientific/academic compression domains
- [ ] Compression analytics dashboard
- [ ] Automated npm publish in CI
- [ ] Python SDK
- [ ] Publish VS Code extension to marketplace

## Key Paths
- Project: /Volumes/AI-Models/tokenshrink (symlink ~/tokenshrink)
- Env: /Volumes/AI-Models/tokenshrink/.env.local (gitignored)
- Schema: /Volumes/AI-Models/tokenshrink/schema/schema.js
- SDK Engine: /Volumes/AI-Models/tokenshrink/sdk/src/engine.js
- App Compression: /Volumes/AI-Models/tokenshrink/app/lib/compression/ (re-exports from SDK)
- Token Costs: /Volumes/AI-Models/tokenshrink/sdk/src/token-costs.js (auto-generated)
- VS Code Extension: /Volumes/AI-Models/tokenshrink/vscode-extension/
- Tests: /Volumes/AI-Models/tokenshrink/tests/ (51 tests, 5 files)

## Known Issues / Notes
- generate-token-costs.mjs has HISTORICAL_ENTRIES to preserve safety nets after dictionary cleanup
- npm 2FA requires web auth (no OTP codes) — must publish manually via browser
- gpt-tokenizer is devDependency only (not shipped in SDK)
- VS Code extension not yet published to marketplace (needs `vsce` packaging)
